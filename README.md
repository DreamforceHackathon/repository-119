**Tell the story behind the code. What inspired you? **

From last several months I was personally struggling to meet my daily goals, failing on expectations and juggling with the every growing task list.  On doing a lot of research and feedback, we realized that this is a much bigger problem that needs to be addressed with a simple solution. We decided to approach this common problem with proven principles of Eisenhower matrix and the wildly successful pomodoro technique into a simple solution Simpledone..
